Feature selection for Gene prediction in metagenomic fragments

Datasets:
datasets for training and testing are available in the Orphelia  website http://orphelia.gobics.de/datasets.jsp 

Open reading frame (ORF) extraction:
We use Orphelia a metagenomic ORF finding tool to extract ORFs from each fragment. Then, we pick left-most ORFs from each ORF-set to  further analysis.
Feature extraction and feature selection:
